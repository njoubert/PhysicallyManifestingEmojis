# Physically Manifesting Emojis!

Technically, this project is an Internet-connected Stepper Motor built on the Intel Galileo platform. 

Experientially, it's a fucking MAGIC-MACHINE that BLASTS EMOJIS INTO YOUR ROOM from ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

Realistically, it's a 

## Architecture

The Intel Galileo listens for Ethernet packets. A down-and-dirty hand-written HTTP parser extracts just enough info to figure out what to do. Either a webpage (stored in a C string, ha) gets piped back, or, some new action for a stepper motor is calculated. Stepper motor commands are then executed. 

I should have just said "this is a giant, fun, hack."

## Developing

The Arduino code lives in the .ino file, edit it with the Arduino console.

The webpage being served is rotateme.html. Run `make` to autogen it into a C string (stored in the autogenerated webpage.h).
